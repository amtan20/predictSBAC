# predictSBAC
Final Project for MSDS699 Machine Learning Laboratory

# Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop a binary classification machine learning model that could predict whether or not a student would pass the Math SBAC (California's end of year exam). My interest in creating this model stems from my five years of experience as a middle school and high school math teacher. Teachers have access to hundreds of different datapoints about their students, but the challenge is knowing which datapoints are most indicative of a student's future success. The model uses student demographic information, beginning of year assessment scores and mid-year assessment scores to predict student outcomes at the end of the school year. This model can be used by teachers in the middle of the school year to help them make better-informed decisions about which students to place in targeted intervenion groups. If we provide extra support to the students who are not on track to pass the SBAC and can appropriately fill the gaps in their knowledge, we can increase their chances of passing the SBAC. 

# Data
The data is from students at a single middle school in the 2018-2019 school year. I received written permission from the school leader to use this student data for this project. All identifying information was removed in order to comply with FERPA student privacy guidelines. 

# Algorithms 

# Evaluation Metrics 
I looked at 2 different evaluation metrics when comparing models - f1 and precision. 

# Findings 
The features that were most important for making predictions
